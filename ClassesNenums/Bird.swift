// Next, create an enum called Diet. (This enum does not need to do any comparisons, so it does not need to have any raw values associated with it.) The cases for Diet should be meatEater and vegetarian.

// Then create an enum called Sex. The cases of this enum should be male and female.

    // Create a method called eat(otherTrex:). This method should take one parameter of type Trex called trex. If the instance of Trex which calls on this method is faster than the parameter that is passed in, it should "eat" the other Trex (by setting the other Trex's isAlive property to false).
